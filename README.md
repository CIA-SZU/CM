# Code for XGBEA
This code runs on [PlatEMO](https://github.com/BIMK/PlatEMO). 

We have tested it on PlatEMOv3.2, but do not guarantee its compatibility with other versions.

## Installation
Unzip *XGBEA.zip*, and put the whole folder *XGBEA* in the directory *PlatEMO/Algorithms/Multi-objective optimization* of PlatEMO, and run it by PlatEMO GUI or command.

## Note
The surrogate model relies on the MinGW-w64 C/C++ compiler, to install it, please use the "Add-ons" menu. 
1. In the **ENVIRONMENT** section of the MATLAB **HOME** tab, click **Add-ons** -> **Get Add-ons**. 
2. Search for MinGW and install it.
